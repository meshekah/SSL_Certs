This code is used to get the SSL connection information from the Alexa top one million website.
The code can be easily extendable to get the SSL connection informtion from all the IPv4 address by simple modification to the code.

The code has been developed using python 2.7.5 with mySQL version 5.6.11. MySQL must be running for the majority of this code to work. You should have a VERY good internet connection as this will be making a million SSL connection to gather information.

The following python libraries has been used:
MySQLdb, OpenSSL

The DB visuallized schema is available in "schema.architect" under the DB folder. You must create a database (i.e. schma) called CRL.

To get started just run:
     python crl_crawling.py -h
